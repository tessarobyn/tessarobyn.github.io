          <h4>Skills and Technologies Used</h4>
          <p>HTML, CSS & JavaScript</p>
          <h4>Aims</h4>
          <p>
            'Last Left' was the first website I built that used a substantial
            amount of JavaScript to control it. I decided to build this game
            specifically as I had already worked out the game logic and finer
            details when I built it in Python, meaning I could focus on learning
            how JavaScript works and how to apply it to a relatively simple
            game. Also, I found that implementing a game made it easier to learn
            how to use classes and objects in JavaScript, as there were classes
            such as 'Player' and 'Enemy'. The objects created from these were
            tangible and represented on the screen.
          </p>
          <h4>Successes</h4>
          <p>
            As this was my first attempt with JavaScript, I was very happy with
            the outcome. I felt a lot more confident using JavaScript and could
            appreciate how much of a difference it makes to websites. One of the
            most difficult parts of building this game was to create an
            algorithm that would randomly generate walls for each game, but I
            think it turned out well.
          </p>
          <h4>What Improvements Could I Make?</h4>
          <p>
            As this game requires access to a keyboard, it cannot be played on a
            touchscreen device without an external keyboard. When I styled the
            game, I made sure it was responsive to all screen sizes, but I would
            need to add touchscreen support so it can be used on all devices. It
            may also be worth adding some kind of leader board, which would
            require a backend being added to the web app. My Python version of
            this game used SQL to read from, write to and update a leader board
            database, so I could create something similar for this.
