              I fell in love with front-end web design and development because
              it combined my love of art with my passion for programming. I
              enjoy adding my own creative flair to projects, and being able to
              create all my own assets, meaning I can design and build a fully
              fledged website.</i
            >
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          I have been programming for multiple years now, mostly in an
          educational setting. Within that time, I have become confident in
          HTML, CSS & JavaScript. My first language was Python, so I am also
          comfortable using it for a range of applications. More recently, I
          have been trying out JavaScript frameworks, such as Vite, React, and
          Express. These help me to push my websites to the next level and make
          larger websites more easy to maintain (in some cases). I have also
          spent some of the last year learning mobile app development using Dart
          and Flutter. This has opened up a whole new world of opportunities to
          me and I look forward to seeing where it takes me in the future.
        </p>

          I have always had a soft spot for art, having been creating all sorts
          of things from a very young age. More recently, I have become more
          focussed on my art, specifically graphics, which has greatly helped
          with my design and execution of websites. I have recently learnt how
          to use the Adobe suite, as well as Figma, which I find is a wonderful
          tool for designing and prototyping.
